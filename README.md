# Prior to release:

- we need to have a database that won't have it's limit exceeded within 24 hrs
- strong password protection

# TODO

## Major

- Graphs
- Sharing functionality
- synopis http://www.yelp.com/biz/metro-balderas-1-san-jose#query:tacos

## Minor

- Twitter Videos
- multiple links within a tweet - get URLs out of the corresponding key in tweets

- Vines

- loop and update datum times
- preloaders
- get the number of pixes per colum to determine which column to place the next datum instead of the current hack
- datums per second toggle

- codox
- slamhound
- Apply the insights from SS's workflow http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded

## Bugs

- Some tweets are not showing up - I would bet that they are the twitter photos
- Using HTML5 history will not unsubscribe/subscribe you from trends as expected.
- We will, on occasion, see a preloader AND some datums
- Historical datums don't work perfectly
- New datums are being appended, even if they are the same as the old datum. This rarely happens.
- A trend from last week is not = to a trend this week
- not catching exceptions anywhere in this program

## Misc

- Eric want's to have the datums take up less space. 

- most commmon keywords + an example tweet
